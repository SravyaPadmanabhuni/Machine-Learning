# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML algorithms use statistical methods to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on input data. This allows machines to improve their performance on tasks like recognizing images, understanding speech, predicting trends, or personalizing recommendations over time as they are exposed to more data.

In this repo we will be creating series of ML topics and modules used for it like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn...
